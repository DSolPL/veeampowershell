# Collect-GuestLogs

# ðŸ“— Documentation

## Project Notes
**Author:** Chris Evans <br>

## **Description:**
Automated collection of Windows **guest OS** logs for troubleshooting of Veeam Backup jobs with _Application Aware Processing_ enabled (ie. SQL/Exchange/Active Directory/SharePoint/Oracle).

## **Requires:** <br>
Local Administrator permissions to be able to execute the script as Administrator.

## **Usage:** <br>
* Download the script (**Collect-GuestLogs.ps1**) and save it to the guest server where logs need to be collected.
* Open PowerShell with Administrator permissions and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
* Run the following to execute the script.
     (Note: PowerShell's Execution Policy is set to _RemoteSigned_ by default on Windows Server machines. This is the reason _Unblock-File_ command is ran prior to calling the script.)
```
Unblock-File .\Collect-GuestLogs.ps1
.\Collect-GuestLogs.ps1
```
* Wait for the script to finish executing. The PowerShell console will contain information about what's happening at each step of the process. Once it finishes it will automatically open Windows Explorer to the location of the created .zip file (*<datetime>_<servername>.zip*).
* Upload the .zip file that was created to your Veeam support case.

## **Features** <br>
This script will collect the following information from the server and bundle everything together into a single .zip file.

* Collects _GuestHelper_, _GuestIndexer_ and other logs located in _%ProgramData%\Veeam\Backup\_ (or alternate configured directory)
* Collects output of various VSSAdmin commands: Writers/Shadows/ShadowStorage/Providers
* Collects output of SystemInfo.exe
* Collects various registry values (_Veeam Backup and Replication_, _SCHANNEL_ and _System_ hives specifically) to check for various settings that affect In-Guest Processing
* Checks for Veeam registry values which may have leading or trailing whitespace which would cause them not to work as intended
* Collects list of installed software
* Collects permissions for all SQL users for each database if one or more running SQL instances have been detected
* Collects information about connected volumes
* Collects list of accounts with Local Administrator permissions
* Collects status of Windows Services
* Checks if '_File and Printer Sharing_' is enabled/disabled
* Collects _Application_ and _System_ Event Viewer logs
* Collects _VMMS_ Event Viewer logs if Hyper-V role is detected
* Collects status of Windows Firewall profiles
* Collects settings of attached NICs
* Collects list of installed features/roles
